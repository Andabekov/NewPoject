			<p>
				Number of decks: 1<br />
				Number of cards in the deck: 36<br />
				Number of Players: 4 <br />
				The cards: 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.<br />
				(Note: 6s serve as a reference for scoring. Jacks are always trump cards and seniority is determined by suit:
				diamonds, hearts, spades, and clubs.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal:<br />
				To win the game in one of two ways:
				1. to collect 12 points in the game
				2. pick up all the cards in the hand/distribution (this is called "paupers" or "naked")
			</p>
			<p>
				Rules of the game:<br />
				Players play in two pairs (teams). The companions sit opposite to each other. In the first hand deliverer is
				determined randomly. After that, deliverer changes clockwise.
				The deck must be shuffled carefully, and each player must be dealt 8 cards face down on the two cards at
				once counter-clockwise.
				After the cards are dealt, trump suit is determined by the hand. In the first hand the trump suit is always a
				Club. In the next hand, trump suit is determined as follows: after the first hand played identify and remember the
				player who had Jack of Clubs and that player is given a suit of Clubs, whereas the player who sits to the right of
				him is assigned to Hearts, the player in front of him is assigned Spades, and player on the left of him is assigned
				Diamonds. In the next hand, a player who will baptize Jack of Clubs is obliged to inform other players about it
				and trump suit is determined by the suit assigned to him at first hand.
				The first move belongs to the player who sits to the right of the deliverer, and he has the right to go to
				any card. His card determines the suit of the drawing. All players take off on one card. They must put the map
				same suit, if there is no map of the suit, the player may discard any card:
				1) not a trump suit: whoever has the highest card gets the drawing
				2) trump suit (Jacks always belong to the current trump suit): player gets the drawing, unless there is
				another card with trump suit was played. In the latter case, the drawing goes to highest card owner among them.
				Then determined by the player who takes a bribe, the same player has the right to start the next rally.
				After eight draws, where players will be left at the hands of cards, count the number of points in the hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				The cost of cards in glasses:<br />
				Ace - 11 points;<br />
				10 - 10 points;<br />
				King - 4 points;<br />
				Queen - 3 points;<br />
				Jack - 2 points;<br />
				7, 8, 9 - nothing.<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				The total number of points of all the cards 120. The number of points in the party and the number of
				points in each hand is different. A team which scored between 61 and 90 points in the hand, opens up a point in
				the party, if scored from 91 to 119 points exclusively, it opens up 2 points. If a team gained 120 points in the
				hand and took all the bribes (this is referred to as "paupers"), the game is won, otherwise also added 2 points. If
				a team gained 60 points, the points are not added in the party.
